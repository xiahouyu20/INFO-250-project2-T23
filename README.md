### Introduction
$~~$ We select a relevant information visualization that we think should have some improvements in this project. A detailed explanation of the information visualization is provided. We give our advise about how to improve the visualization and make an improved visualization.  
$~~$ The link of the original visualization is:  
$~~$ https://www.chinadailyhk.com/epaper/pubs//chinadaily/2022/09/30/15.pdf
<br>
### Other Work
$~~$ At the begining of the work, we selected three visualization that may have deficiencies. We made replications for all of the three visualizations, and make improvement for two of them. We decided to adopt one visualization that shows 7 China's economic indicators in the past decade as our project target.  
$~~$ Those pre-work will be showen in catalogue **other_work**.
